== DESCRIPTION

Radix provides the means of converting to and from any base.
In addition, representational notations need not be in
ASCII order; any user-defined notation can be used upto
base 62.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Convert to and from any base.
* User-definable character set upto base 62.
* Defaults to standard base 62.
* Can be used to encode strings.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

Base conversions with ASCII ordered notations are easy in Ruby.

  255.to_s(16)   #=> "FF"
  "FF".to_i(16)  #=> 255

But Ruby reaches it's limit at base 36.

  255.to_s(37)   #=> Error

Radix provides the means of converting to and from any base.

  Radix.convert_base([100, 10], 256, 10)
  #=> [2,5,6,1,0]

And it can handle any notation upto base 62.

  Radix.convert("10", 62, 10)  #=> "62"

And the notations need not be in ASCII order --odd notations
can be used.

  b10 = Radix.new([:Q, :W, :E, :R, :T, :Y, :U, :I, :O, :U])
  b10.convert("FF", 16) #=> "EYY"
