= Sexy API

There first version of Radix worked well enough,
but its API was very functional and thus a bit difficult
to read at a glance.

To improve upon this Radix now offers an option operater
API.

  require 'radix/operator'

With it, the #b method extends String and Array classes to
simplify all mulit-base operations.

  r = "AZAZ".b(62) + "54".b(10)
  r.assert == ""

  r = [100,10].b(256) + "54".b(10)
  r.assert == ""
